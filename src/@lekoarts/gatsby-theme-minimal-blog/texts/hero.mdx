<h2 style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Hi!</h2>

**I'm Phat Pham**, a lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Ho Chi Minh Vietnam.

**I'm great at building MVPs**. Lately I've been focused on cloud native, microservices & serverless architecture.

**I write code & read books in my free time**. Check [BoringCodes GitHub](https://github.com/boringcodes) for what I'm developing for fun.
