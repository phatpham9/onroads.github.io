<h2 style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

**I'm Phat Pham**, a lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Ho Chi Minh Vietnam.

**I'm great at building MVPs**. Lately I've been focusing on Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless to build performance, scalable & highly available distributed systems.

**I write code & read books in my free time**. Check [github.com/phatpham9](https://github.com/phatpham9) for my open source projects.

**Currently I'm taking a break after my own startup failed**. But I still write code for fun in my free-time (you can check [github.com/boringcodes](https://github.com/boringcodes)) & I'm also studying M.S. in Computer Science on the weekend.
