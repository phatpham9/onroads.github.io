<h2 style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

**I'm Phat Pham**, a lifelong learner, tech enthusiast & open source lover from Ho Chi Minh Vietnam.

**I'm great at building MVPs**. Lately I've been focusing on Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless to build high performance & scalability systems.

**I write code & read books in my free time**. Check my GitHub [/phatpham9](https://github.com/phatpham9) for open source projects.

**Currently I'm working at my own startup**, studying M.S. in Computer Science (major in AI) & coding for fun at [/boringcodes](https://github.com/boringcodes).
