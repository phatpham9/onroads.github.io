This website was published 5 years ago with the only purpose which is sharing my portfolio. Three years later, I introduced a new look of the website after finding out Gatsby framework was so awesome for static web app so I could base on it to develop more features for my website. Many things have been added to the to-do list so far but there have been the one always in pending status that is `Creating a Blog`.

And today, I start writing.

#### But why I need a blog!?

There're three reasons:

- **Learning**: Beside daytime working, I also write code for fun or put my hands dirty on the new technologies in my free time. Writing down what I have learned is a good practice for my brain which forces it to remember a thing 2 times.
- **Keeping**: A lot of thoughts about technology that many times I couldn't find a desired place to post on. A personal website is the best one for storing them.
- **Sharing**: Blog posts on personal website are also easier for sharing to another website in order to discuss & take feedbacks from everyone else. That are what I really want to improve myself and do networking.

#### And what I will write about!?

The following topics are what I've been focusing in the next 2 years:

- Cloud Native, Microservices & Serverless
- Productivity Tools & Methods

#### So how about the writing schedule!?

I think I will publish one post a month in the next 3 months. Later It will be increased maybe :).
